Here's a website with a list of restaurants where the user can choose the one they like and add products to the cart.

The products of only one restaurant are stored in the basket,
when choosing another place, the basket will be reset.

The data is taken from the server. 
Sorting and adaptive design are implemented using javascript and tailwind. 
TypeScript also applies.
